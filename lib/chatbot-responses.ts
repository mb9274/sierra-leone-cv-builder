    return `**ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Checker** - Check if your CV passes employer screening software!

**WHAT IS ATS?**
90% of employers in Sierra Leone and worldwide use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) - software that automatically screens CVs before humans see them. If your CV isn't ATS-compatible, it gets rejected even if you're qualified!

**For Job Seekers:**
1. Go to Dashboard and click "ATS Checker"
2. Select the CV you want to check

✅ **Keyword Optimization** - Do you have important industry keywords?
✅ **Content Quality** - Are descriptions detailed enough?
✅ **Contact Information** - Is everything properly formatted?

⚠️ **Warnings:**
- Summary too short (under 50 words)

- No keywords matching job requirements

**FOR EMPLOYERS:**
Use the ATS Checker to:
• Verify candidate CVs are complete
• Check if applications meet quality standards
• See if CVs have proper formatting
• Ensure candidates followed best practices

**GETTING A GOOD SCORE:**

To pass ATS systems (score 70+):
1. **Complete all sections** - Don't leave education, experience, or skills empty
2. **Use keywords** - Include terms from job descriptions
3. **Write detailed descriptions** - At least 3-5 lines per work experience
4. **Use action verbs** - Start descriptions with: Managed, Developed, Achieved, Led, etc.
5. **Format properly** - Phone: +232 format, clear section headers

**AFTER CHECKING:**
• Get personalized recommendations
• Edit your CV based on feedback
• Re-check until you score 70+
• Take Learning Center courses on CV writing

**WHY IT MATTERS:**
Even the best candidates get rejected if their CV can't pass ATS. Our checker helps you:
- Get past automated screening
- Reach human hiring managers
- Stand out from other applicants
- Increase interview chances by 300%

**WHY CONTEXT MATTERS:**

**For Summary Generation:**
You need to enter FIRST:
✅ Your education (degree, field of study)
✅ Your work experience (at least position)
✅ Your skills (at least 2-3)

Then the AI can write: "Results-driven Computer Science graduate with 2 years experience as Software Developer specializing in web development..."

**For Experience Bullet Points:**
You need to enter FIRST:
✅ Position/job title
✅ Company name
✅ Brief description of what you did

Then the AI generates: "• Developed responsive web applications serving 10,000+ users
• Reduced page load time by 40% through optimization
• Led team of 3 developers on key projects"

**For Skills Suggestions:**
You need to enter FIRST:
✅ Your field of study
✅ Your work experience or interests

Then the AI suggests relevant skills for YOUR specific field.

**HOW TO USE IT RIGHT:**

**Step 1:** Fill in your basic information
• Name, email, phone, age
• Education details
• At least one work experience OR describe what you want to do

**Step 2:** Click "Generate with AI"
• Now the button will work!
• AI uses YOUR information to create personalized content
• Much better than generic templates

**Step 3:** Review and edit
• AI gives you a starting point
• You can customize it to match your style
• Add more specific details

**WITHOUT CONTEXT:**
Generic: "Motivated professional seeking opportunities..."

**WITH YOUR CONTEXT:**
Personalized: "Dynamic Accounting graduate from Fourah Bay College with internship at Rokel Bank, skilled in QuickBooks and financial reporting, seeking to join a growing finance team in Freetown."

See the difference? Always fill in your details FIRST, then use AI to enhance them!`
